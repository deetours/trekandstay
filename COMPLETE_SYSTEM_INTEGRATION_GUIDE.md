## 🏗️ **System Architecture Overview**

Your system has **3 interconnected layers** that work seamlessly together:

```
📱 WhatsApp API ←→ 🧠 Lead Management ←→ 🤖 RAG Chatbot
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Real-time chat      Pipeline tracking    AI-powered responses
  Lead capture        Stage automation     Knowledge retrieval
  Message automation  Task creation        Context-aware chat
```

### **🎯 Core Philosophy:**
- **Every WhatsApp message** → **Creates/updates a Lead** → **Triggers automated workflows**
- **AI chatbot** → **Provides instant customer support** → **Integrates with lead pipeline**
- **All systems sync** → **Real-time updates** → **Complete customer journey tracking**

---

## 📱 **WhatsApp Integration Flow**

### **1. How Customer Messages Reach Your System**

```
Customer sends WhatsApp message
       ↓
WhatsApp Business API receives message
       ↓
Webhook sends to your Django backend: /api/whatsapp/webhook/
       ↓
Django processes message and creates/updates Lead
       ↓
Automated workflows trigger based on message content
       ↓
Response sent back to customer via WhatsApp API
```

### **2. Lead Creation from WhatsApp** 

**File: `backend/core/views.py` - `whatsapp_webhook` function**

When a customer sends their **first WhatsApp message**:

```python
# Automatic Lead Creation Process:

1. Clean phone number (remove formatting)
2. Search for existing lead by phone number
3. If NO existing lead found:
   ✅ Create new Lead with:
      - phone: customer's phone number  
      - whatsapp_number: same phone number
      - source: 'whatsapp'
      - stage: 'inquiry' (starting stage)
      - metadata: stores first message, timestamp, session info
   
   ✅ Create initial Task:
      - type: 'initial_contact'
      - status: 'pending' 
      - due_at: 1 hour from now
      - description: 'Follow up on WhatsApp inquiry: "message preview..."'

4. If existing lead found:
   ✅ Update existing Lead:
      - metadata: add latest message info
      - whatsapp_number: ensure it's set correctly
      - Update last contact timestamp

5. Log interaction:
   ✅ Create LeadEvent:
      - event_type: 'whatsapp_message_received'
      - metadata: message content, session ID, platform info
```

### **3. Message Processing & Intent Detection**

**File: `WHATSAPP_INTEGRATION.md` - `process_whatsapp_message` function**

Your system **automatically analyzes** every incoming message:

```python
# Intent Detection Examples:

🔍 BOOKING KEYWORDS detected ("book", "booking", "reserve"):
   → Send: "Great! I'd love to help you with your booking. Which destination interests you?"
   → Update lead stage to: 'interested'
   → Trigger: Booking workflow automation

💰 PRICING KEYWORDS detected ("price", "cost", "how much"):
   → Send: "I'll send you our latest pricing. What dates are you considering?"
   → Create task: Send pricing information
   → Stage remains: Current stage

❓ HELP KEYWORDS detected ("help", "support", "question"):
   → Send: "I'm here to help! What can I assist you with today?"
   → Route to: Customer support queue
   → Priority: Set to 'medium'

🎯 TRIP KEYWORDS detected (matches trip names in database):
   → Auto-link lead to specific trip
   → Send trip-specific information
   → Update metadata with trip interest
```
